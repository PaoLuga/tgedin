## When Reality Becomes a Choice

The idea came to me while walking along Valencia's beach, watching the sunset paint the sky in hues of pink and orange. I observed my girlfriend gradually being absorbed by the peaceful scene, visibly shedding the stress she had carried throughout the day. In that moment of tranquility, my mind wandered to a curious reflection about all I had been learning.

I realized that everything I was studying and pursuing had one underlying goal: finding happiness—that horribly complex yet fundamentally simple notion. For me, I think happiness might be defined as having the chance to live multiple lives, to experience the full spectrum of human possibility that circumstances normally restrict.

The question emerged unexpectedly: Is reality the only thing that can ultimately fulfill us? Or is reality itself merely what we perceive through our senses—a personal interpretation layered onto whatever exists independently of our consciousness?

This wasn't merely an abstract philosophical musing. I've become increasingly aware of how thin the membrane between the "real" and the "constructed" truly is.

## The Fluidity of Perceived Reality

Our experience of reality has always been mediated. We don't experience the world directly; we experience our brain's interpretation of sensory signals. What we call "reality" is already, in a sense, a kind of virtual reality — a simulation constructed by our neural architecture from limited sensory inputs.

What AI now promises is not a complete departure from reality, but rather an extension of this already-existing process of reality construction. The difference is one of source and control: natural reality comes to us from the external world, while AI-generated realities could emerge from our own desires and imaginations, powered by increasingly sophisticated technology.

Key observations about our relationship with reality:

- Our perception is already filtered through biological algorithms (our sensory systems)
- What we interpret as "real" is always incomplete and subjective
- The boundary between "authentic" experience and "mediated" experience has never been absolute
- Technology has always shaped not just what we can do, but what we can perceive and experience

## The Promise of Artificial Worlds

As AI continues its exponential evolution, we approach a horizon where artificially generated worlds might become sensorially indistinguishable from what we consider "reality." These would not be mere escapist fantasies but potentially rich domains for experiences that physical reality, with all its concrete solidity, cannot provide most individuals.

Imagine being able to:

- Experience the strategic challenges and moral weight of leadership during critical historical moments
- Feel the transcendence described by stylites or samanas who dedicated decades to spiritual practices
- Know the particular quality of being loved in ways that circumstances or chance have denied us
- Test ourselves in situations that reveal character without the permanent consequences of failure

The promise here isn't escapism but expansion — an extension of human experience beyond the limitations imposed by the singular path that circumstance has allowed each of us to walk.

## The Paradoxical Return to Authenticity

Yet here lies the profound paradox I've been contemplating: might these AI-generated worlds, rather than diminishing our appreciation for unaugmented reality, actually deepen it?

I suspect that widespread access to rich, sensorially convincing artificial experiences would not lead to mass rejection of baseline reality. Instead, it might illuminate what makes unaugmented reality uniquely valuable — its unscripted nature, its resistance to our desires, its fundamental indifference to our preferences.

After experiencing worlds shaped by our own desires, the rustic simplicity of a reality that simply is — regardless of our wishes — might appear not as a limitation but as a profound form of authenticity. The very solidity and resistance of physical reality, its refusal to bend to our whims, might be recognized as a necessary foundation for meaning.

This perspective brings to mind the contrast between the physical world and the digital realm. Physical infrastructure has a concrete reality that software lacks — a bridge stands or falls regardless of what we believe about it. There's something irreplaceable about this quality of physical reality, even as we increasingly embrace the more malleable world of data and algorithms.

## Democratizing Transcendent Experience

Throughout human history, certain experiences have been available only to the fortunate few. The monk who could dedicate decades to meditation, the aristocrat with leisure to pursue philosophy, the commander with opportunity to test their courage — these were exceptional cases, not the common experience.

What if AI could democratize access to these dimensions of experience? Not as replacements for lived reality, but as supplements to it — windows into aspects of human potential that circumstance has placed beyond most people's reach?

I believe such technologies would not replace reality but contextualize it — helping us see our singular, shared world not as the only possible reality but as the fundamental one, the necessary foundation from which all other experiences derive their meaning.

## The Ineffable Substance of Existence

The French philosopher Merleau-Ponty spoke of the "flesh of the world" — the primordial substance that precedes the distinction between subject and object. Perhaps what we might discover through these artificial realities is that authentic existence has a particular quality that cannot be fully replicated precisely because it is not designed.

The "indicible" (ineffable) quality of raw existence — its absolute independence from our desires and designs — may prove to be irreplaceable. The AI worlds might be as sensorially real as physical reality, perhaps even more vibrant and responsive, yet still lack this fundamental quality of being genuinely other than ourselves.

As I witness the evolution of technologies that generate increasingly convincing simulations, I find myself more aware of the distinctive quality of undesigned reality. There is something in the random pattern of raindrops on a window, in the unplanned encounter with a stranger, in the stubborn materiality of physical objects, that resists complete digitization. I felt this acutely while watching the waves on Valencia's shore—their patterns both random and rhythmic, utterly indifferent to human desire yet profoundly affecting.

## A New Appreciation

My suspicion is that far from devaluing authentic reality, these AI-generated worlds would likely make us appreciate the simplistic beauty of our shared world more deeply than ever before. The very qualities that can make reality seem limiting — its indifference to our desires, its resistance to our control — might be recognized as the foundation of its unique value.

As I navigate between the physical world and the expanding digital domains, I find myself developing a keener appreciation for both. The digital offers possibilities for exploration and creation that physical reality constrains; the physical grounds us in a shared existence that digital realms can only approximate. Perhaps this is what I was sensing as I watched my girlfriend find peace in that sunset—a momentary harmony with a reality that simply is, unfiltered and undesigned.

## The Universal Pursuit of Happiness

What ultimately makes me believe that these new dimensions of experience will be globally beneficial for humanity is a simple yet profound observation: we cannot do something that doesn't make us happy. The critical distinction lies in the temporality of the happiness we seek.

Even when someone engages in self-destructive behavior, they do so to relieve themselves from a current pain, trading immediate relief for potential long-term suffering. Our choices always reflect a pursuit of happiness—whether momentary or lasting—even when these pursuits appear paradoxical to outside observers.

What these AI-generated experiences might offer is not an escape from this fundamental human drive, but a more expansive canvas upon which to pursue it. They could provide more people with access to "the key"—that elusive combination of experiences, insights, and perspectives that unlocks a deeper, more sustainable form of fulfillment.

In sharing these virtual worlds of possibility, we might collectively discover more paths to genuine happiness on our physical soil. The expanded horizons of artificial experience could paradoxically ground us more firmly in the authentic joys of unmediated reality, helping us distinguish between fleeting pleasures and enduring fulfillment.

As we navigate this new frontier, perhaps the most profound question isn't whether AI worlds can perfectly replicate reality, but whether they can help us recognize and cherish what makes our embodied experience irreducibly valuable.
