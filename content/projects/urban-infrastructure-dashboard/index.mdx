# Urban Infrastructure Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases my unique blend of civil engineering knowledge and data science skills through an interactive dashboard analyzing urban infrastructure data. I'll be working on this project thoroughly during my data science journey, and the entire codebase will be available as an open source project on GitHub.

## Project Overview

I'm creating a geospatial analytics dashboard that helps city planners and engineers make data-driven decisions about infrastructure maintenance, resource allocation, and future development.

## Data Requirements & Sources

**Core Datasets:**

- **Infrastructure Inventory Data**:
    - OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for Valencia's roads, bridges, pipelines
    - Valencia Open Data Portal (datos.gob.es)
    - EU Open Data Portal for infrastructure datasets

**Supplementary Data:**

- Historical maintenance records (synthetic if necessary)
- Traffic/usage data for different infrastructure elements
- Weather data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap
- Census/demographic data for neighborhoods

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Processing (2 weeks)

1. **Set up development environment**:
    - Create GitHub repository with well-structured README
    - Set up Python environment with necessary packages
    - Configure PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension
2. **Data acquisition scripts**:
    - Write API connectors for OSM and weather data
    - Download static datasets from government portals
    - Create data scrapers where needed
3. **ETL pipeline implementation**:
    - Clean and transform raw data
    - Implement geospatial joins between datasets
    - Create feature engineering functions

### Phase 2: Analysis & Model Building (3 weeks)

1. **Exploratory data analysis**:
    - Generate statistical summaries of infrastructure conditions
    - Create preliminary visualizations of geographical distributions
    - Identify patterns in maintenance needs
2. **Predictive modeling**:
    - Develop deterioration models for different infrastructure types
    - Implement risk assessment algorithms
    - Create maintenance priority scoring system
3. **Resource optimization module**:
    - Build algorithms for optimal resource allocation
    - Implement cost-benefit analysis functions
    - Create "what-if" scenario simulation capabilities

### Phase 3: Dashboard Development (3 weeks)

1. **Backend API development**:
    - Create Flask/FastAPI backend
    - Implement endpoints for data queries
    - Set up caching for performance optimization
2. **Frontend development**:
    - Build interactive map interface using Mapbox or Leaflet.js
    - Create data visualization components with Plotly or D3.js
    - Implement filtering and parameter selection interface
3. **Integration and deployment**:
    - Connect frontend to backend
    - Deploy to cloud platform (Heroku, Render, or AWS)
    - Set up CI/CD pipeline for updates

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines, database design, API integration
- **Data Science**: Predictive modeling, risk assessment, spatial statistics
- **Machine Learning**: Regression for deterioration prediction, classification for risk categories
- **Visualization**: Interactive maps, time-series charts, comparative analytics
- **Domain Knowledge**: Infrastructure lifecycle understanding, maintenance planning principles

## Portfolio Presentation Elements

1. **GitHub Repository**:
    - Well-documented code with clear README
    - Architecture diagrams
    - Data dictionary
2. **Live Demo**:
    - Deployed dashboard with sample data
    - Use case demonstrations
3. **Technical Blog Post**:
    - Document your approach and methodology
    - Highlight challenges and solutions
    - Publish on Medium or personal website
4. **Presentation Video**:
    - 5-minute walkthrough explaining the project
    - Focus on both technical implementation and business value

## Extension Possibilities

Once I've completed the core project, I'll consider these extensions:

- Add predictive maintenance scheduling using machine learning
- Implement natural language generation for automated insights
- Create mobile-responsive version for field engineers
- Add real-time sensor data integration capabilities

## Open Source Commitment

This project will be developed as an open source initiative, with all code available on GitHub. I believe that urban planning and infrastructure management tools should be accessible to municipalities regardless of their resources, and I hope this project can contribute to more data-driven decision making in urban development.

I'll be regularly pushing updates to the repository as I progress through each phase of development. Contributions, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome!
