# Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp

In March 2025, I embarked on an intensive 16-week journey into the world of data science and machine learning at 4Geeks Academy in Valencia, Spain. This project documents my progress, new skills, and the real-world applications I'm developing as I transition from civil engineering to data science.

## Program Overview

The 4Geeks Academy Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp is designed to transform participants from beginners to job-ready data professionals in just 16 weeks. With a project-based curriculum, I'm gaining hands-on experience across the entire data science workflow:

## My Goals

By enrolling in this bootcamp, I aim to:

1. **Bridge the gap** between my civil engineering background and data-driven problem solving
2. **Develop a robust toolkit** of data science and machine learning skills
3. **Build a portfolio** of real-world projects demonstrating my capabilities
4. **Connect with the community** of data practitioners in Valencia and beyond
5. **Explore applications** of data science in urban planning and development

## Next Steps

As I progress through the bootcamp, I'll continue updating this page with new learnings, projects, and insights. I'm particularly looking forward to:

- Building machine learning models for predictive analysis
- Learning deep learning techniques for image recognition
- Developing a capstone project focused on urban infrastructure optimization
