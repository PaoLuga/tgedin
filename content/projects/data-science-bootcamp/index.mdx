# Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp

In March 2025, I embarked on an intensive 16-week journey into the world of data science and machine learning at 4Geeks Academy in Valencia, Spain. This project documents my progress, learnings, and the projects I develop throughout this transformative educational experience.

## Program Overview

The 4Geeks Academy Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp is a comprehensive program designed to transform participants from beginners to job-ready data professionals. The curriculum covers the entire data science workflow, from data collection and cleaning to advanced machine learning techniques and deployment.

## My Goals

By enrolling in this bootcamp, I aim to:

1. **Bridge the gap** between my civil engineering background and data-driven problem solving
2. **Develop a robust toolkit** of data science and machine learning skills
3. **Build a portfolio** of real-world projects demonstrating my capabilities
4. **Connect with the community** of data practitioners in Valencia and beyond
5. **Explore applications** of data science in urban planning and development

## Next Steps

As I progress through the bootcamp, I'll continue updating this page with new learnings, projects, and insights. I'm particularly looking forward to applying machine learning techniques to urban planning challenges and exploring how AI can help create more livable, efficient cities.
