Personal and Profesionnal Blog
Learning Blog Project
About This Project
This repository contains the source code for my personal blog built with Next.js and deployed on Vercel. The blog serves as both a learning platform for modern web development and a space to document my journey from civil engineering to data science and machine learning.

Project Purpose
This blog serves two main goals:

To learn and practice the required tech stack (Next.js, Vercel, MDX, etc.)

To publish and organize my progress in data science and machine learning in a structured manner

Tech Stack
