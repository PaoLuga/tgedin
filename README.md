# ThÃ©o's Blog

Welcome to my blog! ðŸš€

This is where I document my adventures from civil engineering to data science, and occasionally rant about technology, cities, and life. Expect a mix of code, coffee-fueled insights, and the occasional existential crisis.

Built with Next.js, MDX, and a lot of stubbornness. Enjoy!
